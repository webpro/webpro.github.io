# Open Source Contributions

## Tools

- [Release It!](https://github.com/webpro/release-it) is an interactive release tool, meant to be used with Git repositories and npm packages.
- [reveal-md](https://webpro.github.io/reveal-md/) is a small Node utility to serve Markdown files as beautiful reveal.js presentations. I once [extended reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/pull/329) with the feature that allows writing slides in a single, separate Markdown file. This command line utility is taking advantage of that by converting the Markdown file to a reveal.js presentation and show it in the browser.
- [dyson](https://github.com/webpro/dyson) is a simple yet powerful Node server for creating JSON endpoints to develop against when building web applications. Configure endpoints using templates and simulate real services and data stores to boost development performance.
- [Benchmark suite runner](https://github.com/webpro/benchrunner) is a framework for easily writing performance tests in JavaScript.

## Libraries

- [DOMtastic](https://webpro.github.io/DOMtastic/) is a small, fast, and modular DOM & Event library for modern browsers. Having the same familiar API as jQuery (but without the extra "weight" of modules like `$.ajax`, `$.animate`, and `$.Deferred`), it works great stand-alone or paired up with e.g. Backbone.

## Miscellaneous

- [Programming Principles](https://github.com/webpro/programming-principles) is an overview of generic programming principles and patterns.
- [Awesome Dotfiles](https://github.com/webpro/awesome-dotfiles) is a curated list of dotfiles resources.
- [Bookstore](https://github.com/webpro/bookstore) is a little demo application to learn GraphQL, Next.js, and integrate with auth providers such as Facebook Login.
- [Websites vs Web Applications](https://github.com/webpro/Websites-vs-Web-Applications) may serve as a basis to explain progressive enhancement and how it relates to websites, web applications, and overly complex, responsive & adaptive applications.
- [JS Framework Playground](https://github.com/webpro/frameground) is a project to try various frontend JS frameworks, and get a feeling for what can be accomplished with any framework in various areas.
- [Pre-compiled templates](https://github.com/webpro/precompiled-templates) is a small repository containing research and configuration for some template engines. Minimal footprint and best performance are important factors here. I also wrote Require.js plugins to compile templates at runtime and during the build process ([requirejs-handlebars](https://github.com/webpro/requirejs-handlebars), [requirejs-hogan](https://github.com/webpro/requirejs-hogan), and [requirejs-dust](https://github.com/webpro/requirejs-dust)).
